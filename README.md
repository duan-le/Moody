## How did we build Moody?
Moody is developed using Python and the Discord API. Moody's emotion analysis functionality is made with the help of Perspective API's machine learning models which allows for the identification of abusive and toxic messages within a Discord server. A record of users who are toxic are kept in a database using MongoDB Atlas. Moody is deployed and hosted using Heroku.

The following technologies were involved in the making of Moody:
